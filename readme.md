In this programming task, it was asked that we create a program for Codetown Burger Co to help with with ordering burgers. In order to interact with this program, prompts will be given to the user asking whether they want a specific item. They can answer different things depending on how the prompt asks you to word it. 

Some prompts such as, "Would you like tomato[0], or no tomato[1] for burger 1", ask you to answer with 1 or 0. Whereas some prompts such as, "Would you like, 0, 1, 2, or 3 patties for burger 1", ask you to answer with an amount. 

You can order an infinite amount of burgers and customise each burger. At the end of customising each burger it will show you the current cost.

After ordering and customising all of your burgers, the total cost will be displayed and then ask the user if they would like to tip. If they select "y", the user can input what percent of the total cost they want to tip. The program will then thank them for tipping and then end. If the user inputs "n", the program will wish them a good day.
